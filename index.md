# Welcome to the SkywardAI Community documentation site!

Skyward.AI is an ambitious initiative spearheaded by the AI enthusiasts from RMIT. Our mission is to leverage advanced AI techniques to revolutionize the way we approach programming, making this domain more accessible, efficient, and integrated with cutting-edge AI capabilities.


WE are decicated to providing an Open-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework that empowers you build, customize, and deploy RAG solutions for your specific needs.


# Here, you'll find:

## A robust and modular RAG framework

Our open-source framework provides the building blocks you need to develop and implement RAG models for live chat, including modules for data retrieval, knowledge base integration, response generation, and more.


## Comprehensive data analysis tools

Gain valuable insights into your live chat interactions with our data analysis tools. Analyze user queries, track response effectiveness, and identify areas for improvement.

# A collaborative community of developers and enthusiasts

Share your experiences, collaborate on projects, and contribute to the advancement of open-source RAG technology.


**Our mission is to make RAG accessible and beneficial for everyone.** By providing an open-source framework and data analysis tools, we aim to empower developers and businesses to:


## Build customized and efficient RAG solutions

Tailor your RAG models to your specific domain and use case, ensuring optimal performance and relevance.

## Gain deeper understanding of user needs

Analyze chat data to identify trends, understand user behavior, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Contribute to the open-source community

Share your knowledge, collaborate on projects, and help advance the state-of-the-art in RAG technology.
